    "text": "Hi, I’m Spencer Mitchell. I am passionate about leveraging technology to tackle complex challenges by creating innovative AI solutions, advancing scientific research, and collaborating on impactful software projects.\n\n\nAbout Me\nAs a scientist at Insmed, I specialize in developing biotherapeutics by leveraging state-of-the-art protein models and collaborating closely with wet lab scientists to bridge computational methods with experimental research. I also bring experience as a software build engineer at Ansys, where I contributed to the development of Fluent, a leading fluid dynamics simulation software. My primary responsibilities involved transitioning the build system to SCons, overseeing compiler updates, and maintaining build infrastructure.\nMy academic background reflects a dedication to innovation and precision. At Dartmouth College, I earned a Master of Science in Computer Science on scholarship while working in the Chris Bailey-Kellogg lab. At the University of California, San Diego, I completed a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry and Cell Biology, conducting research in the Douglass Forbes lab. Between UCSD and Dartmouth College, I pursued postbaccalaureate studies in Computer Science at Oregon State University, supported by a research scholarship, and contributed to research in the Eric Walkingshaw lab. This strong educational foundation complements my professional expertise in therapeutic design and software engineering.\nMy academic contributions include a first author publication, Building blocks and blueprints for bacterial autolysins, and secondary author publication, Bioinformatics-driven discovery of novel Clostridioides difficile lysins and experimental comparison with highly active benchmarks.. These works highlight my expertise in bridging computational methods with experimental biology.\n\n\n\nFeatured Projects\nI’m working on a book, NLP: From Simple to Spectacular, a guide to natural language processing that introduces key concepts and explores advanced applications in a practical and accessible way.\nI also developed pdb-attach, an open-source Python library designed to attach the pdb debugger to processes that are no longer connected to the terminal. \n\n\nLet’s Connect\nI’m always interested in chatting, whether that’s about code or really anything. You can reach me through email (smitchell556 at gmail dot com) or LinkedIn.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
