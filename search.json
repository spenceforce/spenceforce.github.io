    "text": "Welcome to my blog! I’m Spencer Mitchell, a computational biologist specializing in therapeutic protein design. While my work primarily involves algorithms and models for protein sequence data, this blog takes a different direction, focusing on natural language processing (NLP) and the algorithms associated with it. There are striking similarities between protein sequence modeling and NLP. Both involve sequential, tokenizable data, where understanding the context of each element (be it an amino acid or a word) is crucial for interpreting the overall structure and function.\nNLP has become a cornerstone of modern technology, powering everything from virtual assistants to language translation, and yes even protein design. Through this blog, we’ll explore the fascinating world of NLP algorithms, from basic concepts to advanced techniques. I aim to teach these concepts from first principles in plain Python, then build on them using machine learning and deep learning frameworks like sklearn, PyTorch, and Hugging Face. Whether you’re new to programming or an experienced data scientist, my goal is to make these concepts accessible and engaging.\nJoin me on this adventure as we dive into the world of NLP, uncovering its inner workings and exploring its vast potential. Together, we’ll learn about the magic of natural language processing and its real-world applications.\nHeck, this about page was written with help from ChatGPT and the logo was made with Bing Image Creator!"
