# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can you refer me for a job at your company?

If I don't know you, the answer is no. I will not put my reputation on the line to refer someone I know nothing about.

## What skills do I need for industry XYZ?

Google it.

## Can you review my resume?

For a friend, yes. For a stranger, no.

## Are you interested in job XYZ?

I'm willing to sit down and discuss the role if the compensation package makes sense. If you are unwilling to share the compensation package up front, then I am not interested.
